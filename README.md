A lackluster sidescroller and level editor, for demonstration purposes.

This was meant to go along with a presentation, possibly in 2006 or so. Unfortunately, I didn't get a lot of time
to do much with it, and came to the artist pretty late with my requests (thus the "tiled" map...). Also, with some
frantic night-before coding, the presentation itself was rather a blur. :/

This may have been between the UI editor projects, or maybe not. In any case I just made some stripped-down modules
anyhow, not really using too much from the nascent TacoShell.
